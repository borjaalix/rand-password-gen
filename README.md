The assignment was completed when: I was able to create variables for an array of characters needed to meet criteria. Then, apply those arrays to a master array. I then, created a for loop in which I used "Math.floor" and "Math.random" to randomize the characters within the master array. Finally I set that array to a variable and pushed that through as a resolution.
